# Kue

  Priority job queue backed by Redis.

## Installation

    $ npm install kue

## Creating Jobs

 First create a job `Queue` with `kue.createQueue()`:

```js
var kue = require('kue')
  , jobs = kue.createQueue();
```

  Calling `jobs.create()` with the type of job ("email"), and arbitrary job data will return a `Job`, which can then be `save()`ed, adding it to redis, with a default priority level of "normal". The `save()` method optionally accepts a callback, responding with an `error` if something goes wrong.

```js
jobs.create('email', {
    title: 'welcome email for tj'
  , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
  , template: 'welcome-email'
}).save();
```

## Priorities

 To specify the priority of a job, simply invoke the `priority()` method with a number, or priority name, which is mapped to a number.

```js
jobs.create('email', {
    title: 'welcome email for tj'
  , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
  , template: 'welcome-email'
}).priority('high').save();
```

  The default priority map is as follows:

```js
{
    low: 10
  , normal: 0
  , medium: -5
  , high: -10
  , critical: -15
};
```

## Job Logs

 Job-specific logs enable you to expose information to the UI at any point in the job's life-time. To do so simply invoke `job.log()`, which accepts a message string as well as variable-arguments for sprintf-like support:

```js 
job.log('$%d sent to %s', amount, user.name);
``` 

## Job Progress

 Job progress is extremely useful for long-running jobs such as video conversion. To update the job's progress simply invoke `job.progress(completed, total)`:

```js
job.progress(frames, totalFrames);
```
